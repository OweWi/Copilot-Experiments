# Copilot-Experiments

A collection of experiments investigating GitHub Copilot's behavior with various local models and programming languages. Although online models are powerful, some applications lack internet access or involve private codebases.

## Project goals
- Compare suggestions from multiple local LLMs (e.g., Llama family, Mistral) when used in GitHub Copilot workflows.
- Evaluate multilingual performance across several programming languages.
- Record prompts, contexts, outputs, and simple metrics for reproducibility.
